aland haval dev log

ok so i fixed some talwind issues in the admin page approvals which were cousing some overflows and breaks that was making the ui sgluggish now before i start with my tasks rawa has set for me i was exploring the app and noticed two issues first theres a issue where the edit page of the articles inn the my articales page is not wroking and also we have a waiting approvals page thats not updated to meet the ui standards of the other pages and stuff so im going to fix that
fixed the article edit page today it was crashing with some blocknote error about initialcontent turns out the database was storing content as empty object {} but blocknote needs an array so i changed the article editor to check if its actually an array and not empty otherwise just pass undefined also made the edit page fallback to empty array if content isnt valid then i updated the prisma schema to default to [] instead of {} and ran a migration plus made a script to fix the 4 existing articles that had the wrong format also noticed the editor was stuck in light mode even in dark mode so i added usetheme hook and made it dynamic with resolvedtheme so now it switches properly between light and dark everything works now
